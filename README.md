 AI-Driven Predictive Analytics for Preventive Healthcare

Problem Formulation

Project Annotation
This project addresses the challenge that many patients receive treatment only when their health issues are advanced. This is an important issue because early intervention can improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs. Using Business Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence, we will analyze health and lifestyle data to develop models that can predict the risk of diseases and the need for preventive measures. The solution can help healthcare providers offer more proactive treatments and support citizens in leading healthier lives.

Research Questions
1. How can BI and AI be used to analyze health data for preventive purposes?  
2. Which factors in lifestyle and patient history are most predictive of disease risks?  
3. How can predictive models be integrated into a usable BI solution for healthcare providers?  

Hypotheses
- H1: A combination of demographic data, lifestyle data, and health records can predict an increased risk of lifestyle-related diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease).  
- H2: Visualizations and dashboards can help non-technical users (e.g., healthcare staff) better understand risk patterns.  
- H3: Implementing predictive models can support earlier interventions and reduce future treatment costs.  

Project Setup
- Development Tools:**  
  - GitHub repository for version control and documentation  
  - Python (Jupyter, pandas, scikit-learn) for data analysis and modeling  
  - BI and visualization tools (Power BI / Tableau / Dash)
